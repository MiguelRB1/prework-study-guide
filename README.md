# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

In a nutshell my aim was to make an easy and fun study guide to help me through my coding journey. I built this site to prove to myself that I CAN code and its not that hard when you actually dive in. In the end, I think my problem is solved despite the setbacks and the very rushed timeline.
